For Creative Mornings, I help maintain the Rails codebase and have worked on many projects to improve both user and developer experience. Some highlights:
- Localized time on event pages, which became a needed feature for users who were visiting virtual, non-local chapter events.
- Updated the app from an older version to Rails 6, helping improve security and performance for Creative Morning users, and the speed and ease of local development for my team.
- Improved our Docker setup, reducing image size from `3.7GB` to `1.7GB`, reducing the resource intensity during local development.
